# Pie OS for KudOS
For now, this will be just a test to get ANYTHING working with the kernel. Later I will make this actually the pieOS.

## Updating
If KudOS changes and you want to update your version you're using:
```bash
cargo update
```

## Doing stuff with the code
### Building
```bash
cargo build
```
### Running
```bash
cargo run
```
### Testing
```bash
cargo test
```
